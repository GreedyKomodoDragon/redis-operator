                              seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                              It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                              Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                              "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                              This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                              "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                              This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                              It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                              Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                              whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                              CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                              "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                              and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                              This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                              All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                    The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                    the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
                  properties:
                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
                      type: string
                    key:
                      description: |-
                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
                      type: string
                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                    tolerationSeconds:
                      description: |-
                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
